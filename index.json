[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am currently in my final year of the Ph.D. program at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, PR China, under the School of Computer Science.\nI am working as a researcher at the BIT Advanced Network and Data Security Lab for the last four years where I am supervised by Prof. Zhu Lie Huang and Prof. Kashif Sharif. During my research tenure in BIT, I have co-authored multiple high-impact SCI-indexed journals and conferences. Some of my first-authored articles are currently under review in different journals. Before joining BIT, I received ME (Master of Engineering) and BE (Bachelor of Engineer) from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), Xiâ€™an, in 2015 and 2012, respectively. I was awarded a fully-funded Chinese Government Scholarship to pursue the Ph.D. and BE programs. Besides, I was also given a University Scholarship by NPU to study the ME program. I achieved an average band score of 7.0 in both Academic and General IELTS in 2015. Additionally, I completed a Cisco Certified Networking Professional (CCNP) Routing and Switching Certification in 2014 and a Cisco Certified Networking Associate (CCNA) Security Certification in 2013 during my ME studies. I also completed one year elementary Mandarin Chinese Language Course at Tianjin University in 2007 before starting my BE studies.\nMy current research concentrates on building an integrated networked system for specialized distributed hierarchical networking environments integrating Internet-of-Things (IoT), Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies. Despite recent innovation on Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Multi-access Edge Computation (MEC), and Machine Learning (ML), it is still challenging to combine these individual technologies as an integrated solution in terms of optimizing and orchestrating traffic engineering, content dissemination, and distribution. Therefore, I concentrate on solving these challenges to innovate unique ways to bring the content closer to the consumer while keeping the system load and other parameters optimal. These innovations would benefit the entire networked ecosystem achieving low latency, high throughput, minimal delay, minor packet loss, and low energy consumption. Previously I worked on the performance measurement and benchmarking of multiple SDN controllers in a lightweight network environment to utilize the maximum efficiency of an SDN controller in an IoT-oriented network environment.\nMy primary career objectives are multi-folded. Firstly, as a Research Assistant (RA), I intend to do my research in theoretical, analytical, and practical implementation and applicability in Machine Learning (ML) and Edge Computation techniques from the distributed heterogeneous networks (HetNet) and future generation cellular networks (i.e., 5G, 5G Evo. and 6G) perspectives. Secondly, as a network architect, I aim to design, build and innovate modern computer networking architecture. Finally, as a network engineer, I strive to manage and troubleshoot physical and virtual networking devices.\n","date":1620699336,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1620699816,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://karimmd.github.io/author/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently in my final year of the Ph.D. program at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, PR China, under the School of Computer Science.\nI am working as a researcher at the BIT Advanced Network and Data Security Lab for the last four years where I am supervised by Prof.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"authors"},{"authors":[""],"categories":["Tutorial"],"content":"There are multiple ways to install NS-3 on Linux OS.
