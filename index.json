It provides control beyond the virtual switch elements in intra and inter-domain communication and extends the range of programmability to wireless devices, such as the Internet of Things or vehicular networks. Extensive simulation results show that the traffic load is distributed evenly on multiple links connecting different domains. We model data center communication and 5G vehicular network communication to show that, by load balancing the flow completion times of the different types of network traffic can be significantly improved.","tags":[],"title":"DOLPHIN: Dynamically Optimized and Load Balanced PatH for INter-domain SDN Communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liehuang Zhu, Md M.
