However, contemporary blockchains are not suitable for Industry 5.0 applications due to their inability to ensure high throughput while maintaining reasonable security levels. Hence, in this paper, we design a user-centric sharded blockchain that enables generating, verifying, and storing blocks of data related to individual users with the aim to satisfy their QoS, security and privacy requirements. By analyzing the impact of user allocations to shards on the block period, we devise the user-shard allocation algorithm to minimize the block period or, equivalently, maximize the system throughput, and demonstrate the superior performance of our framework via simulations.","tags":[],"title":"User-Centric Blockchain for Industry 5.0 Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shaoliang Zhu","Alia Asheralieva","Md Monjurul Karim","Dusit Niyato","Khuhawar Arif Raza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639180800,"objectID":"93a6edd40fd8754e37b1c3ef241f8687","permalink":"https://karimmd.github.io/publication/zhu2021secure/","publishdate":"2021-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu2021secure/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated learning (FL) enables multiple learning devices to exchange their training results and collaboratively develop a shared learning model without revealing their local data, thereby preserving data privacy. However, contemporary FL models have many drawbacks including limited security against malicious learning devices generating arbitrarily erroneous training results. Recently, a promising concept - coded distributed computing (CDC) has been proposed for maintaining security of various distributed systems by adding computational redundancy to the datasets exchanged in these systems. Although the CDC concept has already been adopted in several applications, it is yet to be applied to FL systems. Accordingly, in this paper, we develop the first integrated FL-CDC model that represents a low-complexity approach for enhancing security of FL systems.

Nevertheless, existing IoV blockchain models suffer from poor security against collusion attacks instigated by malicious blockchain miners typically represented by roadside units (RSUs). To address this problem, additional block verifiers, e.g., vehicles, can be recruited during block verification, which enhances security but also can lead to the reduced throughput. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a resource management scheme for IoV blockchains to enhance the system security while maximizing the throughput by optimizing contributed computing resources from RSUs and recruited vehicles. We show that the optimal strategies of RSUs and vehicles can be found through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and verify (using simulations) that our scheme achieves the higher throughput with enhanced security compared to the existing IoV blockchains.","tags":[],"title":"Throughput-Efficient Blockchain for Internet-of-Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Khuhawar Arif Raza","Alia Asheralieva","Md Monjurul Karim","Kashif Sharif","Mehdi Gheisari","Salabat Khan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633996800,"objectID":"46d3912e70e720d4767d1ae5be283569","permalink":"https://karimmd.github.io/publication/raza2021novel/","publishdate":"2021-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/raza2021novel/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Information -Centric Networking (ICN) framework to enable low latency-based stateful routing and caching management by leveraging a novel forwarding and caching strategy.

It utilizes Pending Interest Tables (PIT) instead of Forwarding Information Base (FIB) to perform data dissemination among peers in the proposed IC-SDN framework.

It also makes use of four beacon nodes instead of traditional three with weights applied to reflect the impact of each node for the centroid position. The weight factor applied is the inverse of the distance estimated. Simulation results show higher localization accuracy and precision as compared to traditional weighted centroid algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Quadrant-Based Weighted Centroid Algorithm for Localization in Underground Mines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1482232500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1482232500,"objectID":"369483c672364fc79bdc6abb6cc5b0aa","permalink":"https://karimmd.github.io/talk/an-introduction-to-network-function-virtualization/","publishdate":"2016-12-20T19:15:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/an-introduction-to-network-function-virtualization/","section":"event","summary":"Frontier of Computer Science Fall 2016","tags":[],"title":"An Introduction to Network Function Virtualization","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479608100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479608100,"objectID":"ba3ab8436765dde46850ab4b64ce2022","permalink":"https://karimmd.github.io/talk/simulation-of-multiple-tcp-variations-using-ns-3/","publishdate":"2016-11-20T10:15:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/simulation-of-multiple-tcp-variations-using-ns-3/","section":"event","summary":"Advanced Computer Network Fall 2016","tags":[],"title":"Simulation of multiple TCP Variations using NS-3 ","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://karimmd.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
