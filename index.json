I am fortunate enough to gain some valuable research experience at the BIT Advanced Network and Data Security Lab, where I am collaborately supervised by Prof. Zhu Lie Huang and Dr. Kashif Sharif. Before joining BIT, I received ME(Master of Engineering) and BE(Bachelor of Engineer) from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u0026rsquo;an in 2015 and 2012, respectively.\nMy current research concentrates on building an integrated networked system for specialized distributed hierarchical networking environments such as 5G, IoT, VANET, and sensor networks. Despite the availability of recent innovation such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Multi-access Edge Computation (MEC), and Machine Learning (ML), it is still challenging to combine these individual technologies as an integrated solution in terms of optimizing and orchestrating traffic engineering, content dissemination, and distribution. Therefore, I concentrate on solving these challenges to innovate unique ways to bring the content closer to the consumer while keeping the system load and other parameters optimal. These innovations would benefit the networked ecosystem itself in terms of low latency, high throughput, low energy consumption, and the likes.\nPreviously I worked on the performance measurement and benchmarking of multiple SDN controllers in a lightweight network environment to utilize the maximum efficiency of an SDN controller in an IoT-oriented network environment. In the future, I intend to continue theoretical, analytical and practical research on Machine Learning (Network and Telco perspective), Edge Computing and 5G Evolution (6G).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://karimmd.github.io/author/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently in my final year of Ph.D. program at Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, PR China under the Computer Science and Technology School.

It provides control beyond the virtual switch elements in intra and inter-domain communication and extends the range of programmability to wireless devices, such as the Internet of Things or vehicular networks. Extensive simulation results show that the traffic load is distributed evenly on multiple links connecting different domains. We model data center communication and 5G vehicular network communication to show that, by load balancing the flow completion times of the different types of network traffic can be significantly improved.","tags":[],"title":"DOLPHIN: Dynamically Optimized and Load Balanced PatH for INter-domain SDN Communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liehuang Zhu, Md M.
