abstract="Location sensing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a critical problem when it comes to rescue operation in underground mines. Most of the existing research on node localization uses traditional centroid algorithm-based approach. However, such approaches have higher localization error, which leads to inaccurate node precision. This paper proposes a novel quadrant-based solution on weighted centroid algorithm that uses received signal strength indicator for range calculation and distance improvement by incorporating alternating path loss factor according to the mine environment. It also makes use of four beacon nodes instead of traditional three with weights applied to reflect the impact of each node for the centroid position. The weight factor applied is the inverse of the distance estimated. Simulation results show higher localization accuracy and precision as compared to traditional weighted centroid algorithms.",
